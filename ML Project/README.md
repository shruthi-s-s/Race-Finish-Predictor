## 🕹️ How it Works

* **Driver & Team Selection:** Choose any driver and constructor from the current grid.
* **Grid Position:** Use the interactive slider to set the starting position.
* **Instant Results:** Generate a predicted finish position based on 2019–2024 race data patterns.

## 📊 Data & Logic

- **Dataset:** [Formula 1 World Championship (1950–2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) by Rohan Rao on Kaggle — filtered to 2019–2024 race results
- **Models tested:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost — best performing model used for predictions
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy score, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification report
- **Key insight:** Constructor performance plays a significant role alongside grid position in determining final race results
